		 <h4><strong>Help I am confused!</strong></h4>
			<p>When I first started out with the idea software developement I was overwhelmed as I did not know where to start.
			   What lanuages did I need to learn, what was my style i.e front end dev, back end dev. There are so many choices.
				 I started doing research on schools and jobs espcially remote opportunities as there are not alot of great options
				 for high paying jobs where I live. The best place to start out in my opinion is to think of what you want to do with
				 software development. Is it a means to an end,a whole new career. No matter what you see yourself doing you first need to
				 learn the foundation or the roots of being a dev. You would want to learn HTML and CSS first. This is the backbone of all sites.
				 If you feel comfortable with these two languages then you can move onto the fun stuff and more easier programs that do alot of the
				 work for you.<p>

		 <h4><strong>Starting With The Basics!</strong></h4>
			<p>Take a breath a and just relax and be excited as you are about to start on your journey of becoming an awesome coder! Before you start stressing about what languages to
			   learn lets just start start wit the foundation of or basics of coding. It is important to learn HTML,CSS, javascript and maybe jquery. Starting with HTML and CSS are the first languages you want
		     to start. Once you become familiar and start enjoying writing code with HTML and using CSS to make your sites look awesome then you can start with other languages. You do not have to be HTML and CSS gurus
		     from the get go, its ok to have a solid understanding of these two languages and use notes and cheatsheets until you know it like the back of your hand!</p>

			<p>There are great sites that offer free course in about every language along with online coding schools that are affordable! When it comes to being a developer you have some pondering to do before starting,
				 do you want to become a back end dev or a front end dev. Are you more technie or more of a designer and have a creative mind! Things to think about and research on your path of becoming a developer!
